#furthermore moving ahead with the topicd yet we learned about the different printing statements which carries the value within themselves now lets learn how to take arbitary values to the variables at run-time i.e during the execution of the program.
#input() :- input() is the function used in python programming to take the values as per the user hence the user defined value, as the values are defined the user itself.

#input1
var=input()
print(var)

#lets check what happens if the value is passed to the input() function
#input2
var= input("Enter the string: ")
print("this is","",var)

#input3
print("Tell me it's funny")
var=input()
print("its",var,"Really funny")
